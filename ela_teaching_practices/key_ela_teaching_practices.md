# Middle/High School ELA

| Move | Teacher Actions | Student Behaviors | Coach Prompts |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **1. Do Now Start** | • Greets students; gives immediate entry directions. • Projects timer; students begin in 1 minute. • Launches with a literacy habit (annotation, quickwrite). • Circulates for early engagement. | • Enter quietly and begin Do Now. • Annotate/jot independently. • Prepare to share with a peer. | **"How will you ensure students begin independently within the first minute? What cues set your literacy tone?"** |
| **2. Direct Instruction** |  • Begins with clear learning target objective Makes thinking visible • Connects briefly to prior learning (genre, craft, theme). • Models structure if unfamiliar (e.g., annotation routine). | • Listen silently. • Ask clarifying questions Share thinking with peers  | **"How will you connect the text to your thinking? How will you make the thinking visible and explicit for students? "** |
| **3. Student Work Time: Reading/Writing Habits** | • Names goal (e.g., "Underline evidence of character motivation"). • Circulates to check annotations/writing. • Gives quick reminders. • Stops class to reteach a habit if needed. | • Apply reading/writing habits. • Annotate, cite evidence, revise. • Self-correct using cues. | **" What will you look and listen for? How do you ensure access for all students? Is the work aligned to the direct instruction?** |
| **4. Student Work Time: Conceptual Thinking** | • Asks targeted questions ("Why this word choice?" "What motivates this character?"). • Tracks trends across student thinking. • Pushes deeper reasoning and multiple interpretations. | • Explain thinking aloud/in writing. • Use evidence. • Revise interpretations. | **"What conceptual understanding are you listening for? What will you say when you hear strong thinking—or a misconception?"** |
| **5. Discourse Prompts** | • Uses open-ended prompts ("Do you agree?" "Can someone paraphrase?"). • Avoids confirming answers too early. • Models sentence starters. • Captures ideas on chart paper. | • Use academic language. • Agree/disagree/extend with frames. • Reference peer ideas. | **"Which discourse moves will you model? How will you get students responding to each other?"** |
| **6. Synthesis** | • Selects 1–2 student interpretations or craft moves. • Displays work to anchor discussion. • Asks: "What pattern do we see?" • Summarizes takeaways using student language. | • Compare interpretations. • Identify the big idea. • Connect to learning goal. | **"What work will you highlight and why? Which questions surface the big idea without you summarizing too soon?"** |
| **7. Independent Work** | • Sets expectations: "Show thinking using evidence + explanation." • Provides quiet time. • Circulates to check reasoning. • Directs early finishers to a meaningful extension. | • Write independently. • Use text evidence. • Show full reasoning. | **"What does strong Idependent work look like? How will students understand what counts as high quality? What scaffolds will you provide to emmure access for all learners?** |
| **8. Use of Student Work** | • Selects work showing different interpretations or craft moves. • Publicly shares and invites explanation. • Asks: "What's similar/different?" • Records ideas visually. | • Present thinking. • Ask questions about peer reasoning. • Compare interpretations. | **"How will you use student work to deepen understanding—not just celebrate correctness?"** |
| **9. Batch Feedback** | • Circulates to identify patterns. • Pauses class briefly to model a fix. • Uses minimal-interruption visuals/verbal reminders. | • Listen and revise their work. • Re-check evidence or analysis. • Continue task with improved accuracy. | **"What trends will you watch for? When will you pause class, and how will you keep it tight?"** |
| **10. Monitor & Select for Sharing** | • Tracks interpretations or evidence choices. • Selects a purposeful sample (emerging → strong → unique). • Plans the order of sharing. | • Stick with their strategy. • Participate when selected. • Compare thinking during discussion. | **"Which student contributions will move learning forward? In what order should they share?"** |
|  |  |  |  |
| **12. Lesson Synthesis Through Student Voice** | • Selects key student thinking that leads to the lesson's takeaway. • Asks targeted questions that let students articulate the synthesis. • Captures student language visibly. • Uses printed synthesis only to validate/anchor. | • Reflect on what they learned. • Share ideas connected to the objective. • Revise thinking based on peers. | **"Which student responses build your synthesis? How will you ensure students generate the summary ideas?"** |
| **13. Revoicing & Precision of Language** | • Revoices student ideas using more precise academic language. • Models literary vocabulary (theme, connotation, claim, evidence). • Invites students to refine their language. • Connects language to the text and notes. | • Use informal → formal language progression. • Rephrase peer ideas. • Cite evidence more precisely. | **"Where can you revoice student ideas today? How will you model precision while honoring their thinking?"** |
