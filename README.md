# Nisa's Knowledge Base

This directory contains educational coaching and teaching resources that form the knowledge base for "Nisa" - an AI assistant designed to support math teachers and instructional coaches. These materials provide the foundational framework for understanding effective teaching practices, coaching strategies, and classroom implementation.

## Directory Overview

This workspace contains curated educational resources focused on:
- **Core teaching practices** and instructional moves
- **Math-specific teaching strategies** and discourse techniques  
- **Coaching frameworks** and warm demander principles
- **Summer school implementation models** (313 Model)
- **Knowledge base metadata** tracking resource origins and updates

## File Descriptions & Use Cases

### Core Teaching Framework

**`10 Key Teaching Moves.md`**
- **Purpose**: Defines the foundational teaching moves that constitute effective instruction
- **Content**: 10 essential practices from lesson launch to formative assessment
- **Use Case**: When an LLM needs to understand what constitutes good teaching, provide coaching feedback, or evaluate lesson effectiveness
- **Key Concepts**: Lesson launch, explanations, checks for understanding, classroom routines, student motivation, practice time, feedback, discussion, small group instruction, assessment

**`Key Math Teaching Practices.md`**
- **Purpose**: Math-specific implementation of the core teaching moves
- **Content**: Detailed table showing what each practice looks/sounds like in math classrooms, expected student behaviors, and coach prompts
- **Use Case**: When supporting math teachers specifically, providing concrete examples of what good math instruction looks like
- **Key Concepts**: Do Now starts, task launches, student work time habits, conceptual thinking, discourse, synthesis, cool downs, student work usage, batch feedback

### Coaching & Leadership

**`How to be a Warm Demander.md`**
- **Purpose**: Framework for effective instructional coaching and leadership
- **Content**: Principles of warm demander leadership, exemplar responses to teacher challenges, case studies
- **Use Case**: When coaching teachers who are struggling, providing supportive but challenging feedback, building teacher capacity
- **Key Concepts**: Believe in the impossible, build trust, teach self-discipline, embrace failure, show strength, listen and affirm, challenge and offer choice

### Implementation Models

**`313 Model.md`**
- **Purpose**: Specific summer school implementation model with structured class time and teacher practices
- **Content**: Overview of 313 model structure, "Big Four" teacher practices, week-by-week implementation guidance
- **Use Case**: When supporting teachers in structured learning environments, particularly summer school or intervention programs
- **Key Concepts**: Lesson launch, Zearn/Snorkl independent learning, small group instruction, culture building through routines, student progress tracking

### Instructional Tools

**`Rigorous Math Questions to Promote Mathematical Discourse.md`**
- **Purpose**: Question bank to facilitate meaningful mathematical discussions
- **Content**: 100+ categorized questions that promote mathematical thinking, reasoning, and peer interaction
- **Use Case**: When teachers need specific questions to ask during math lessons, want to promote student discourse, or need to scaffold mathematical conversations
- **Key Concepts**: Question categories for sense-making, self-assessment, reasoning, peer interaction, problem comprehension, conjecture, connections, perseverance

### Knowledge Management

**`Nisa's Knowledge Base - Sheet1.csv`**
- **Purpose**: Metadata tracking for all resources in the knowledge base
- **Content**: Resource names, current content, last updated dates, descriptions, sources, and notes
- **Use Case**: When an LLM needs to understand the provenance of information, track resource updates, or identify gaps in the knowledge base
- **Key Concepts**: Resource tracking, source attribution, update management, content organization

## How to Use These Resources

### For LLM Responses:

1. **Teaching Evaluation**: Use `10 Key Teaching Moves.md` and `Key Math Teaching Practices.md` to assess lesson quality and provide specific feedback
2. **Coaching Conversations**: Reference `How to be a Warm Demander.md` for supportive but challenging coaching approaches
3. **Specific Pedagogical Model Implementation Support**: Use `313 Model.md` if the coach indicates they're working in the 313 model.
4. **Question Generation**: Draw from `Rigorous Math Questions to Promote Mathematical Discourse.md` to provide teachers with specific questions for their lessons
5. **Resource Attribution**: Check `Nisa's Knowledge Base - Sheet1.csv` to understand where information comes from and when it was last updated

### Contextual Application:

- **New Teachers**: Focus on the foundational moves and concrete examples
- **Struggling Teachers**: Emphasize warm demander principles and specific feedback
- **Math Teachers**: Prioritize math-specific practices and discourse questions
- **Coaches**: Use the coaching frameworks and exemplar responses
- **Summer School**: Reference the 313 model structure and implementation timeline

## Key Principles for LLM Responses:

1. **Asset-based approach**: Believe in teachers' capacity to improve
2. **Concrete specificity**: Provide specific, actionable feedback
3. **Evidence-based**: Ground responses in observable teaching practices
4. **Supportive challenge**: Balance encouragement with high expectations
5. **Contextual relevance**: Adapt responses to the specific teaching situation

This knowledge base enables an LLM to provide informed, supportive, and practical guidance to math teachers and instructional coaches while maintaining high standards for teaching excellence.
