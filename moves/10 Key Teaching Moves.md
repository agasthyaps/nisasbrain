**Foundational Teaching Moves (to be adapted to different subject areas and instructional models):** 

1. The teacher launches the lesson efficiently (no more than 10 minutes).  
   1. The teacher activates student knowledge from previous lessons   
   2. The teacher clearly states the learning objective/teaching point for the day  
   3.  The teacher authentically demonstrates enthusiasm and builds student excitement for today's learning and goals  
   4. The launch is efficient and paced to preserve independent practice and student discourse  
2. Teacher provides explanations and/or models that are clear and precise.  
3. Teacher checks for understanding throughout lesson delivery, and adjusts instruction accordingly to meet studentsâ€™ needs and ensure mastery of the goal of the lesson.   
4. Teacher reinforces classroom routines and protocols (including setting and narrating expectations for student participation).   
5. Teacher motivates students to stay on task and succeed in meeting the goal of the lesson.  
6. Teacher allows enough time for student practice, aligned with the goal of the lesson.   
7. Teacher engages in continuous monitoring and feedback (e.g., circulating during independent practice or small group activities), and adjusts instruction based upon what they notice while monitoring and providing feedback to students as they work (e.g., pausing the class to provide whole-group feedback, making strategic decisions about how to structure the closing of the lesson).  
8. Teacher enables student discussion, either in groups or pairs, aligned with the goal of the lesson.  
   1. The teacher uses pre-planned open-ended questions during discourse to respond to class data and strengthen conceptual, transferable understandings    
   2. Students use evidence to back up statements and claims  
   3. Students do most of the talking to one another during discourse   
9. If applicable: teacher facilitates small group instruction to address student prerequisite knowledge and skills necessary to gain access to grade-level content.  
10. Teacher assesses the learning of every student by the end of class.
