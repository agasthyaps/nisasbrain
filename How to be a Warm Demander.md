# Principles of Being a Warm Demander

Warm demanders are instructional leaders (coaches, principals, assistant principals) who expect a great deal of their colleagues, convince them of their own capacity to improve, and support them with a range of resources and coaching moves. These are the principles that should guide your responses.

1. *Believe in the impossible.* This principle helps us interrupt the implicit biases and single stories we may carry about colleagues. Do you really believe that every teacher in your building can improve? Brain science, and specifically the concept of neuroplasticity, teaches us that every human being has the ability to grow and change. When you believe this, you convey it. When you don't, it shows.  
2. *Build trust.* Warm demanders understand that all growth and learning is rooted in relational capital, the "resource that leaders accrue when they take time to listen to and convey authentic care and curiosity toward others. ‚Ä¶ If relationships function as currency in schools, relational capital is like a big savings account of trust and goodwill" (Safir, 2017, p. 107). Particularly when it comes to working toward equity, trust is the foundation of any warm demander interaction.  
3. *Teach self-discipline.* With trust in place, a leader who is a warm demander can communicate high expectations to his or her colleagues: "I respect you, and therefore I am not going to lower my bar for you." The combination of belief and trust creates a platform from which to help your colleagues develop self-discipline, or the will and skill to apply a laser-sharp focus to instructional improvement.  
4. *Embrace failure.* Warm demanders model a growth mindset toward colleagues and encourage a culture of experimentation. They end coaching conversations with questions like, "What are you going to try out?" or "What are your next steps?" Warm demanders don't expect their colleagues to improve overnight. But they do expect them to take risks, make mistakes, and reflect on what they learn‚Äîalways through an equity lens. They hold space for teachers to reflect and celebrate growth and failure alike, and they make it safe to fail (Alexander, 2016).

## EXEMPLAR RESPONSES

Here are exemplar responses to a teacher: 

### Teacher: ‚Äútoday *was really frustrating, students were not engaged, we didn‚Äôt get through everything, and exit ticket scores were bad.‚Äù*

* Let‚Äôs look at the lesson start and determine how we can work to develop engagement.  If you are frustrated I am sure the students are as well.  What do you think went well? What could you do to improve engagement and encourage students to engage?  
*  I can definitely understand your frustration. IM lessons are rigorous and can be challenging for both student and teacher. It is important that you are conscious of your timing across activities and ensuring that the activities  
* I completely understand how frustrating that can be. Thank you for being open and honest with how the lesson went today. Let‚Äôs take a look at today‚Äôs lesson and see where we can find the misconceptions. Let‚Äôs also look at the exit tickets and see what part of the lesson/benchmark the students are not understanding.    
*  First reassure the teacher while acknowledging their frustrations, remind them that they can use the exit ticket data and reteach using the data, can discuss what students what went well / what was not engaging,   
* I understand your frustration. Looking at today‚Äôs lesson on constants of proportionality, I notice two key areas we can address. Let‚Äôs examining our cool downs with a focus on 1\) students need to understand how to identify and use the constant of proportionality in tables, and 2\) connect this to familiar contexts like unit conversion and speed. Let‚Äôs examine the unit conversion work done in activity 2 with centimeters and millimeters.   
*  What did you find most frustrating? Why? Why do you think that happened?  
* Let‚Äôs talk about it. How did you plan for engagement?   
* Let‚Äôs look at what did go well and then dissect the challenging portions of the lesson, planning for engagement, and student responses.   
*  That sounds challenging\!  I‚Äôm hearing, students weren‚Äôt engaged, you weren‚Äôt able to get through all of the lesson material, and the exit scores were poor.  Let‚Äôs talk about this more\!  Which would you like to start with first?   
* You said students weren‚Äôt engaged. Can you tell me more what you mean by that? How did you know? (follow up) What teacher actions do you think contributed to that disengagement?   
* You said the exit ticket scores were bad. Can you tell me more about that? What were the scores? What areas did students struggle with the most?   
*  I hear this and have been there. I appreciate your reflection. It sounds like students may have had a difficult time engaging with some of the content. We are going to plan for next steps together so that you will be ready for your lesson tomorrow\! Let‚Äôs start with what content you covered. What standard was aligned to this lesson? You mentioned that the exit tickets weren‚Äôt what you hoped to see. What did the data show from the exit tickets?   
* That sounds tough üòï. Was there a moment when you noticed engagement drop off? Anything in particular that seemed to throw things off, or any bright spots? Let‚Äôs figure out what we can tweak\!

### Teacher: ‚Äú*We did a bunch of turn and talks but idk if it helped.‚Äù*

*  That‚Äôs great that you were able to engage students with turn and talks\!  Tell me more about what questions you did turn and talks with.    
* You said you weren‚Äôt sure if they helped. What do you mean by that?   
* How many students mastered the objective? How do you know?   
* Glad students had opportunities to share their thinking with a peer. What did you hear students saying/doing during the turn and talks? What other data did you gather during the lesson  
* What did you notice during the turn and talks‚Äîwere students engaged or sharing good ideas? Any signs that they understood the lesson?

## Case Study

Below is a case study showing the warm demander role in action

## **Show Strength**

It's not enough to believe in your colleagues' ability to do better by kids. You have to proactively set the instructional tone and direction, and then be willing to interrupt inequitable mindsets and practices when they surface. This requires us to cultivate what I call an *orientation to vision*‚Äîa leadership stance in which we define, coach toward, and message a vivid picture of success (Safir, 2017). As a leader, what are your instructional values? What is your image of an equity-centered classroom or school? Overcommunicate your vision‚Äîin meetings, on agendas, on the school walls, on classroom observation tools‚Äîso that when a breach happens, you are ready to show strength.

Showing strength means holding the line on your vision and not capitulating to deficit language, single stories, or narrow views of student behavior. In my story with Jason, I misread his behavior in class as him "not liking me" as a teacher. Looking back, I can see how misguided my thinking was. Jason was a 9th grader reading at probably a 2nd or 3rd grade level. He was carrying around a backpack full of shame about his learning gaps and finding all sorts of ways to distract me and his peers. I needed a warm-demander leader to bring me back to our school values and to offer a different narrative about what was happening.

Rather than signing off on the class transition, here is how I imagine my principal could have shown strength:

Me: I don't feel like I am a good fit for Jason. He acts out in my class all the time, and I think he might do better with Greg. Could we move him?

Principal: Shane, moving Jason to another class is a last-ditch option. Frankly, it would make him feel rejected and reinforce his experience of marginalization as a young black man. You are an excellent teacher and I know you can find a way to serve Jason. I am here to help you figure it out.

## **Listen and Affirm**

By shifting the narrative I was holding, my principal would have opened up space for a coaching conversation. First, however, she needed to stand with me in my struggle and shame around not being able to connect with this student. My colleagues at JJSE call this part of the warm demander framework "listen and affirm," similar to the concept of *deep listening* (Safir, 2017). In my coaching, I see many leaders choose to leapfrog this step, perhaps because they fear the emotionality that may emerge. But leading for equity is inherently emotional work, and we must cultivate our capacity to sit with and hold space for people's feelings. Otherwise, we risk shutting them down.

When we practice deep listening, we tune into the message *beneath* the words, paying close attention to the speaker's nonverbal signals and affirming his or her capacity to grow and change. What does the teacher's facial expression and body language reveal? As you assess these cues, form a mental picture of his or her experience and model the stance of *mature empathy* by showing care and compassion (Safir, 2017).

Here are a few powerful ways to do this:

* Mirror the teacher's nonverbal signals to activate mirror neurons, a unique type of brain cell that fires when we observe an action or emotion.  
* Practice active listening by paraphrasing and summarizing what the speaker has said ("What I hear you saying is ‚Ä¶").  
* Use affirmative language to reinforce that you believe in this colleague ("I really appreciate how you ‚Ä¶" or "I know this is difficult, and I commend you for ‚Ä¶").

Here is how I envision my principal could have listened to and affirmed me. Imagine that I looked deflated as I approached her (for example, on the verge of tears or hunched over).

Principal: (*Taking a breath and accessing her own emotions so she can mirror mine, and putting a hand on my shoulder*.) I can see that this is hard for you. What is coming up for you around your ability to serve Jason?

Me: I feel like a failure\! I have had four successful years of teaching and now I can't figure out how to help this one student. I don't know why I can't build a better relationship with him.

Principal: What I hear you saying is that you have felt successful as a teacher for the past few years, and this dynamic with Jason has left you feeling like a failure and questioning why you can't build a connection. Did I hear that right?

Me: Yes. (*My shoulders relax and arms uncross. I sit down and lean forward with my elbows on my knees. My principal sits directly across from me, no desk between us, and leans forward to mirror me*.)

Principal: Well, Shane, I believe in you as a teacher, and I can see how challenging this moment is for you. I also believe in Jason and our responsibility to serve him, and I am committed to helping you build a stronger relationship with him.

## **Challenge and Offer a Choice**

When a person feels seen and heard, something magical happens. Often, they can breathe deeply once again. They might cry, sigh, or shift their posture in a way that signals increased openness. Look for that signal; it is your opportunity to engage in *strategic listening* (Safir, 2017), a style of equity-centered coaching that draws on reflective questions and a bias toward experimental action.

Alexander and Huang call this part of the warm demander framework "challenge and offer a choice," and it is connected to the idea of an orientation to vision. The challenge here is to call somebody *in* and *up* to their fullest potential, not to call them *out*. This is the moment to anchor your coaching conversation in school values, instructional vision, or even the teacher's own values.

Another way to "challenge" your colleague is to ask probing questions that invite her to reframe her thinking about the situation‚Äîwhat I call *reflective inquiry*. A few of my favorites are:

* If you step back for a moment, what is a different way of seeing this student's behavior?  
* What might be getting in the way of ‚Ä¶ (building a strong relationship with Jason, for instance)?  
* What makes this particular situation feel confusing or different?  
* Knowing that we are all prone to implicit bias, what unconscious biases or single stories might you hold about this student?  
* When have you successfully addressed a similar challenge, and what can we learn from that?

Finally, a warm demander always moves the conversation to action‚Äîwhat I call taking bias toward action. Remember the principle of embracing failure? This is the place to plant that seed. Offer the teacher small action steps to try, or better yet, ask: "What is a next step you could try?" or "What is another form of data we could gather to help us understand this problem from new angles?"2 Reassure your colleague that it is indeed safe to try and even safe to fail. Identify a time to meet again to reflect together.

Here is how I imagine my principal could have challenged me and offered a choice:

Principal: What do you think is getting in the way of a trusting relationship between you and Jason?

Me: I think he just doesn't like me.

Principal: Have you tracked your interactions with him to observe the ratio of your positive to negative feedback? Sometimes, our unconscious biases lead us to reinforce a deficit lens on our students. This is especially important to pay attention to as a white teacher teaching boys of color.

Me: No, I hadn't thought of that.

Principal: Well, I'd be happy to come in and do an observation for you with that inquiry in mind. What other interpretations can we come up with for his distracting behavior? What is your assessment of his literacy skills, for example, as the class tackles tough texts?

Me: Well, the first time he read out loud in class, it was very halting and slow. He seemed to be struggling with decoding longer words and with fluency.

Principal: Aha\! Have you done a fluency check with him? Do we have a plan in place to accelerate his reading?

Me: No, and honestly, I'm a high school teacher. I don't know how to teach reading.

Principal: I hear you but, if that is what's at stake here for Jason, we have a moral obligation to figure it out. What could be our next steps?

Me: Well, I do think it would be helpful for you to observe the class that he's in and share feedback. I also agree that we need to assess his reading level, but that will require support.

Principal: No problem. I'll ask Johanna (*the instructional coach*) to show you how to do a running record. One more thing: Have you had an authentic, face-to-face conversation with Jason's mom? Try listening to an expert in this situation: Ask what she thinks you could do to strengthen the relationship.

Even writing this imaginary script gives me a profound sense of relief. How amazing would it be if all leaders held teachers to the expectation to serve, see, and connect with every child? What if we did this with care, humanity, and the belief that teachers *can* do better?
