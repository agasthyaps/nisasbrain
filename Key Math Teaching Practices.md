| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1\. Do Now Start | \- Greets students at the door and gives immediate entry directions. \- Projects a timer and ensures students begin work within 1 minute. \- Clearly states task (e.g., “Start silently. Share in 2 mins.”). \- Circulates to monitor early engagement. | \- Enter quietly and begin work independently. \- Use paper/pencil to record thinking. \- Prepare to share with a peer. \- Use anchor charts or notebooks if needed. | “What’s your plan for ensuring students begin working independently right away? What visual or verbal cues will you use to start class strong?” |
| 2\. Task Launch | \- Begins within 1 minute of Do Now ending. \- Focuses only on what to do, not how to solve. \- Provides 1 example if structure is unfamiliar (e.g., how to sort 1 card). \- Connects briefly to prior learning with a hook. | \- Listen silently to directions. \- Ask clarifying questions about the task structure. \- Begin promptly and correctly. \- Reference modeled example if unsure. | “How will you make sure students know how to start the task without reducing the math thinking? What’s your plan if they’re confused about structure?” |
| 3\. Student Work Time – Habits | \- Names a clear habit goal (e.g., “Label your diagrams with units.”). \- Circulates with purpose, checking written work. \- Gives visual or verbal reminders about expectations. \- Stops class to re-teach if needed. | \- Write reasoning and show work visually. \- Use agreed-upon math habits. \- Self-correct using cues. \- Stay on task individually or with partner. | “Which habit are you reinforcing today? What will you look and listen for to check whether students are internalizing it?” |
| 4\. Student Work Time – Conceptual Thinking | \- Asks targeted questions: “Why this strategy?” “What if you changed the order?” \- Tracks trends across students. \- Pushes multiple representations or deeper reasoning. | \- Explain thinking aloud or in writing. \- Try different strategies. \- Ask questions or revise based on teacher prompts. \- Engage in sensemaking, not just answer-getting. | “What conceptual understanding are you listening for today? What will you say when you hear strong thinking—or a misconception?” |
| 5\. Discourse Prompts | \- Uses open-ended prompts: “Do you agree?” “Can someone rephrase?” \- Avoids confirming correctness too early. \- Models and posts sentence starters. \- Captures ideas visually during conversation. | \- Respond to peers using academic language. \- Agree, disagree, or extend using sentence frames. \- Listen and reference others’ thinking. \- Speak without waiting for teacher validation. | “What discourse moves will you model today? How will you get students responding to each other rather than just reporting to you?” |
| 6\. Synthesis | \- Selects 1–2 student strategies during work time. \- Displays work and invites students to explain. \- Asks synthesis questions like: “What did we learn from this?” \- Summarizes takeaways using student language. | \- Compare peer strategies. \- Identify big ideas from the task. \- Use the synthesis to connect to the learning goal. \- Take notes or reflect aloud. | “Which work will you highlight and why? What questions will help the class draw out the math ideas without you summarizing too soon?” |
| 7\. Cool Down | \- Sets expectations: “Show your thinking in words, pictures, or equations.” \- Provides enough time and silence. \- Circulates to ensure reasoning is visible. \- Directs early finishers to a meaningful extension. | \- Work independently and completely. \- Show full reasoning in writing or visuals. \- Ask for clarification only when needed. \- Transition to next task when finished. | “What does strong Cool Down work look like today? How will you help students understand what counts as complete?” |
| 8\. Use of Student Work | \- Selects work during or after the task that illustrates different strategies. \- Shows work publicly and invites student explanation. \- Asks class: “What’s similar/different?” \- Records ideas or highlights visibly. | \- Present their thinking to the class. \- Ask clarifying questions. \- Compare solutions and reasoning. \- Use peer strategies to build understanding. | “How will you use student work to deepen understanding—not just to celebrate correctness? What responses will you invite?” |
| 9\. Batch Feedback | \- Circulates with an eye for patterns. \- Pauses class briefly if a common issue emerges. \- Models a fix with minimal interruption. \- Uses quick visuals or verbal reminders. | \- Listen to whole-class feedback. \- Re-check their own work. \- Adjust thinking based on the intervention. \- Resume task with improved accuracy. | “What trends will you watch for today? When would it be worth pausing the class—and how will you keep that pause short and clear?” |
| 10\. Monitor and Select for Sharing | \- Tracks strategy use with mental or written map. \- Selects a representative sample (e.g., visual, efficient, unique, partially correct). \- Plans the order of sharing to build learning. \- Uses selected work during share-out. | \- Stick with own strategy during work time. \- Participate when selected. \- Compare their work with others’ during discussion. \- Reflect on math ideas during and after share-out. | “How will you plan your share-out? What student work will move the conversation forward, and in what order?” |
| 11\. Facilitation of Mathematical Language Routines (MLRs) | \- Plans and integrates specific MLRs aligned to the lesson goal (e.g., MLR 3: Critique, Correct, Clarify or MLR 7: Compare and Connect). \- Gives students clear roles and structures for the language routine. \- Models how to engage in the routine (e.g., reading a peer’s work and asking clarifying questions). \- Pauses during or after the task to ensure students process mathematical language in context. | \- Follow structured prompts to describe, compare, or revise mathematical language. \- Engage in partner or group talk using sentence starters provided. \- Ask clarifying questions and offer precise descriptions. \- Use peer feedback to refine their math language or written responses. | “Which MLR will best support your lesson objective today? How will you model and scaffold the language students need to use it effectively?” |
| 12\. Facilitating Lesson Synthesis through Student Voice | \- Selects key moments or student work to build toward the lesson synthesis. \- Asks targeted questions that lead students to articulate the intended takeaway without reading it aloud. \- Captures language and ideas from students and organizes them into a visible summary. \- After discussion, uses the printed Lesson Synthesis only to confirm, name, or reinforce—not as a starting point. | \- Reflect on and discuss what was learned during the task. \- Contribute language and ideas that connect to the objective. \- Listen to peers and revise their understanding based on discussion. \- See their thinking reflected in the posted summary or synthesis. | “What student responses will help you build toward the lesson synthesis? How will you make sure students generate the summary ideas, rather than just reading them?” |
| 13\. Revoicing and Supporting Precision of Language | \- Revoices student ideas by clarifying or refining their language without changing the meaning. \- Models precise use of math terms (e.g., “So you're saying it increases by a constant rate—can we call that a linear relationship?”). \- Invites students to rephrase their own or others' statements more precisely. \- Reinforces the use of visual, symbolic, and verbal representations together. | \- Use informal language initially, then revise with more precise terms. \- Rephrase peer ideas using formal math vocabulary. \- Accept revoicing as a learning tool, not a correction. \- Connect language to diagrams, equations, or graphs. | “What opportunities in today’s lesson will allow you to revoice or support students in refining their math language? How will you model precision without shutting down ideas?” |
