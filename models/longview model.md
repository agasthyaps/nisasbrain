## *Long-View is a transformative education experience.*

**Long-View Micro School offers 80 kids across 2nd through 8th grade an unparalleled education experience. We are not just interested in “doing school” and checking the boxes of all the trappings of a traditional education. We are interested in making sure that the elementary and middle years of a child’s education set the foundation for a lifetime of learning.**

Long-View develops thinking skills, agency, curiosity, and investment in learning. We focus on constructing robust knowledge structures and facilitating the development of conceptual understandings that promote transfer and connections. We support children to be active participants in their own learning by explicitly teaching productive learning dispositions, critical listening, the importance of asking questions, how to take intellectual risks, the importance of participating in discussions, and how to learn within a community.

The culture of Long-View is not built around compliance and behavior management, prominent elements of most schools. Instead, we work to create a learning community. We recognize that all conditions for learning can’t be set by the teacher; kids must make contributions to their own learning. Kids and adults take responsibility for themselves and others. Finally, our philosophy toward homework, in-school learning opportunities, and out-of-school learning opportunities fosters a deep commitment to “driving your own learning.”

# **Learning How To Learn**

Like other teachers and learners all over the country, we are adjusting to the rhythms of a new school year at Long-View and finding our way in new iterations of our learning community. As discussed in many of our posts, including [this one](https://www.long-view.com/blog/what-is-a-learning-community-really) from last spring, the idea of “learning community” is integral to the way we do school at Long-View. A quick version of what we mean when we say “learning community” looks something like this:

*A classroom that operates as a learning community is founded on the understanding that the growth of knowledge involves individual and social processes, and the aim is to enhance both individual learning and group learning. This occurs through supporting individual contributions to a communal effort. Disciplined discourse is key, and the point of learning is to share it with others.*

These ideas may feel a bit foreign to many learners and even parents or teachers, since many of us (likely) were educated in classrooms that engaged in very traditional, behavioristic pedagogy. As adults who want to help children further contemplate these ideas, we might ask questions such as:

*What are you realizing you might do differently to increase your own learning?*

*What is different about a class that functions as a “learning community”?*

*Learning is messy and hard work…what are you realizing is important to do in order to increase learning for yourself and others?*

It is quite a journey for most kids to fully understand the ideas behind these questions. At Long-View, new learners get a lot of support from their peers who have been at our school for multiple years. Parents and teachers can further support children by encouraging them to remember that the transition to a new learning community is a process and that they will not feel like everything is clear on day one, or even in the first few days and weeks–in terms of *how* we learn, as well as *what* we are learning. We need to encourage children to stick with it, to stay in the hard work, and to just make a little progress each day. 

Children may express concern about the transition or discomfort with not knowing how to do everything others are doing.  These concerns may present as worry or anxiousness. At Long-View, we expect this initial reaction, and it is a normal part of the transition. We encourage parents to validate these feelings as they come up and then support their children in reframing this as a part of the learning process. Learning is challenging and true learning often feels hard; we can support children in brainstorming ways to seek support from a teacher or, even better, we can talk with children about ways to go back to their community and ask questions that will unlock learning. As parents and teachers, we can brainstorm with children to think back over what coaching the child has received at school, and we can always support a growth mindset. We can try to normalize the feelings of frustration as much as we can, especially if a child hasn’t had many experiences in school or had an experience in which learning was “hard.” 

In our experience, the most important work for all of us, as parents and teachers, is helping children to **learn** ***how to learn***, including how to advocate for their learning by asking questions (anytime\!—during class, at break, before school, after school, etc). If we can support children in focusing on mindset and learning behaviors as we begin a new school year, these changes will positively impact academic content and skills learning for years to come.

# **How We Think About "Behavior Management"**

“What ‘behavior management’ system do you use?” This is a question we often hear from visiting educators, as well as prospective parents touring the school for admissions. We understand the general impetus for this question, prefaced around wondering whether our classrooms are “well run” or “well behaved” or just based in curiosity with how we “deal” with children who might not be on task in the way we’d like them to be. In many schools, behavior management systems are almost a badge of honor for teachers, proudly displayed as evidence of a classroom under control. And believe it or not, some of us even sat through *entire college courses* dedicated solely to this topic\!

However, the notion of a behavior management system does not square up with our philosophy at Long-View. First and foremost, we do not actually think about “managing” *anyone’s* “behavior.” We are interested in teaching children to productively engage in the learning process with agency, curiosity, and earnestness, and a *system* of *managing behavior* does not serve this goal. So be assured, we are not handing out popsicle sticks or changing cards from green to yellow to red, or giving out stickers, or having everyone sign a contract, or putting demerits on the board. That being said, we are engaged in high-level content, critical thinking, and rich tasks within our classrooms, which necessitate productive interactions, self-management, evolving  communication skills, and awareness of one’s impact on the learning environment. 

Behavior management systems go hand-in-hand with a top down, teacher-centered pedagogy based on traditional behaviorism psychology. If a teacher is attempting to cover content quickly under a philosophy in which children are “empty vessels” who also have little agency within the classroom, then a system to cleanly manage behavior, rewarding those who are compliant and punishing those who distract, is in order. Gimmicks like desk pets, token economies, and clip charts don’t help schools to cultivate, and [may actually diminish](https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/behavior/), a high quality, challenging, rich learning environment like what we strive to foster at Long-View. While productive behavior is a goal, it is equally important that children learn to regulate themselves, assess their behavior against communal norms, and earnestly press towards deep learning.

Therefore, our goal is for students to actively explore, collaborate, problem-solve, and persevere because they *want* to—not because they’re being controlled by an external system. As we design learning experiences, we think about many factors, shooting for a rich experience that doesn’t shy away from complexity, while also helping learners build from what they know. 

Content plays a key role in this process. We focus on presenting material in the most interesting, high-level way possible—something that would engage even an adult learner. For instance, instead of drilling single-digit addition with our second graders, we teach them about unitization, guiding them to understand “the count” and to see terms within an expression. Rather than using an acronym to help our middle schoolers structure an essay and using a worksheet to practice, we study the craft moves of effective authors and push our young writers to plan, draft, think, revise, seek feedback and keep striving to improve work over time, just as published writers do. 

Let’s be clear: we aren’t aiming to entertain. We don’t design “math games” to trick students into learning without them even realizing it. We don’t view content as so boring and dry that we have to find a way to “make it fun” and distract or compel children to inadvertently learn. Entertainment is fleeting, and when it ends, behavior often derails. More importantly, if we want to cultivate thoughtful, reflective, and curious learners, “tricking” them into learning is not the way. We take issue with classrooms that try to force engagement in low-level and unchallenging material with silly games, bells-and-whistles, or rewards.

In addition to content, we think about how learners spend their time, aligning their experiences with how experts in the field work. We prioritize learner agency, allowing children to make choices and take ownership of their learning.

We think about culture and continually nurture this culture; we work hard to establish a culture of learning, interest in the world, and self-direction while being community minded. Instead of *managing behavior,* we focus on teaching *learning behaviors*; we explicitly teach these behaviors to the group and then hold individuals responsible. 

Ultimately, we recognize that we are working with children—young humans who are still learning and growing. When behavior concerns arise, we ask ourselves: “What might these outward behaviors be telling us about what the child is working through internally?” If we see a pattern, we have a conversation with the child, just as we would with any human being. We hold positive assumptions about the intentions of that child, while also coaching the child into mindsets and behaviors that could be more beneficial. Inviting a child into the problem-solving process is another approach we take. We work hard to minimize “top-down” requests, but, as the adults, we do point out when children should make different choices or change something. And, if necessary, we communicate with the child’s parents and work together to move that child forward as needed.  

At Long-View, there is a deep philosophy behind everything we do, from how we design learning experiences to how we address challenges. We aim to honor the authentic human experience and embrace the complexity that comes with it. So the next time you visit a school or speak with a teacher who uses a behavior management system, we hope you might ask them: “Could you tell me more about why? What’s the philosophy behind that?”

## *We have a focused academic footprint—part of the recipe for high-level learning experiences.*

**In order to bring this level of academics to our kids, we take a “less is more” approach.** **Our academic blocks are math, reading, writing, science, and computer science.**

We value many subject areas that we don’t directly teach at Long-View, but when schools try to cover every subject area oftentimes they end up with a very fragmented and frenetic day, and the level of richness during academic learning suffers. Focusing on a select number of subjects allows our teaching team to facilitate high-quality intellectual experiences and honor the complexity of the disciplines.

Additionally, academic blocks—math, reading, writing, science, and computer science—are two hours a day. These longer blocks, punctuated by “brain breaks,” support deeper experiences. Effectively, we get more accomplished in fewer (but longer) blocks of time. Academically, we focus on durable learning, critical thinking, and authentic practice within these disciplines. We continuously ask ourselves, “What is the hardest, richest version of this idea and how can we bring it to the kids?” 

## *We learn in flexible “bands” instead of restrictive grade levels.*

**Long-View learners operate in mixed-age learning groups, which we call “bands.”**

Each band typically has a spread of 2-3 grade levels. Try not to think of this philosophy of mixed-age groups within the traditional practice of "the older kids help support the younger kids" or "the ones who understand a topic teach the ones who are struggling." Neither of these represent the philosophy of Long-View. Mixed-age bands allow us to let go of assumptions related to ages and grade levels and ensure all children are stretching toward the highest expectations. We don’t want kids’ learning put in a box, following the thinking “you will only learn 2nd grade math because you are a 2nd grader.” We typically teach towards the high end of the band (and “high end” doesn’t equate with “eldest” every time). There is no artificial “ceiling” on what kids are exposed to at Long-View and this is crucial to their transformation.

Our four bands are created in the beginning of the year and typically have color names (ex. “Indigo Band”). The band operates as a learning community across all subject areas. Bands typically stay intact across the year, but sometimes individual kids are moved during the year, as we are all about flexibility and we make changes as needed. Our kids are on an upwards trajectory and multi-age cohorts promote stronger learning.

# **Our Assumptions and How They Create a Focus on LEARNING**

At Long-View we are not trying to be another school or just “do school,” but rather we are working very purposefully to create an environment focused on *learning*. 

We define learning as constructing knowledge together. The most important part of our pedagogy is that we are reasoning together, trying to understand something together at a deep level. Everything we do works to create a culture centered around this idea. Rooted underneath that work and culture are the assumptions we make as we approach learning and teaching. 

**We assume children have significant capacity for understanding.**

* We take student thinking seriously and it is a core aspect of classroom work.  
* We do not focus on grade levels or ages when grouping children or planning content because we assume that this focus can, at times, limit learning opportunities.  
* We hold an optimistic view of a child's ability to learn and the potential for change; we then assume that the quality of teacher-child interactions will support growth in cognitive and motivational aspects.  
* “Behavior management” is not something we think about or do. We assume independence and that kids can manage themselves. But we teach into that if things break down.   
* We give responsibility for learning to the learner and we directly teach into this end, scaffolding as needed for age, experience, or motivational factors. Responsibility for learning entails taking more control over your own mental activity and believing that ultimately you are responsible for your own learning and that you can affect the level of your learning.

**We assume deep understanding derives from being a producer.**

* The “products” of learning that we most value are intellectual products that are generated by the learners, including collective knowledge. For example, kids create their own algorithms for solving math problems. They design their own investigations in science and generate their own ideas in writing. They aren’t doing rote work.   
* We see each discipline as a connected set of ideas with authentic practices and we plan classroom content and experiences consistent with this view.  
* “How and why” are important and teachers engage learners in discourse that helps them make sense of the how and why and develop more sophisticated ways of seeing the discipline and thinking within the discipline.

**We assume learning is more powerful when it occurs as a community endeavor.**

* We structure classrooms as learning communities in which the construction of knowledge is supported as a common goal. Learning occurs by constructing knowledge together, not by “being taught.”  
* Discourse is a key pedagogical practice as it makes thinking visible (to teacher and peers), allows for rehearsal of thinking, and makes misconceptions clear so they can be discussed and change can be supported.  
* We make much of the learning and thinking public. Work is often analyzed by peers in order to both advance the knowledge of the entire community as well as enhance the individual’s learning.

**We assume a person’s learning should be directed not just to the present, but also to the “long view.”**

* The content and the experience of the content should lead children to discover the deep principles of the domain and to develop flexible learning and inquiry strategies of wide applicability.  
* Discipline-based learning experiences target the enhancement of cognitive processes and learning mindsets.  
* Beyond deep understanding of content knowledge, we want children to leave with high-level skills in the area of communication, creativity, collaboration and critical thinking.   
* We work to instill an attitude and mindset that learning is the learner’s work to do and that he/she *drives* his/her own learning. 

We think carefully and purposefully about what we do. And we work very hard to create a coherent experience for our learners across their days and years at Long-View. These assumptions and this coherence are what helps us create a transformative learning experience for our children.

## *Long-View doesn't look like your ordinary school.*

**When you step into Long-View, it feels creative and casual, and everyone is invested in learning. It’s collaborative. It is not about compliance and routine, but instead about agency and adaptability.**

The open, airy, and non-traditional physical environment fosters a feeling of community, where kids are known and where we don’t avoid the problems of co-existence. We believe that the best learning spaces are those that have been designed with everyone in mind, that establish a relationship between the space and the outside world, and that are flexible and can be reinvented.

Our urban location allows us to live out a desire to have “porous” walls and maintain a simple facility. We spend an hour a day at the park for lunch, walk to the university to utilize public resources, and make use of a large creek and grassy meadows for science experiments or poetry writing.

# **Experts Come In To Help Us See Out**

When many of us went off to college, we had little perspective on “what we wanted to be” or careers beyond what we saw our parents or close relatives doing. Why didn’t our K-12 experiences help us to better see the possibilities? Why shouldn’t school help to give that perspective? 

At Long-View, we decided to do that. 

To outline this effort and belief, a few years ago we wrote a blog post titled [Learning Within a Larger Ecosystem](https://www.long-view.com/blog/2019/3/31/learning-within-a-larger-ecosystem). It explains “we think of Long-View as a porous organization, and work to use and be part of the wider ecosystem of learning that exists around us.” Further, ”Learning is precipitated on openness, opportunity, connections, depth, and curiosity. At Long-View, we don’t wait for these to find us, but actively seek them out. Interacting with professionals and specialists helps us gain perspective as we learn about a high-level topic.” You can read that blog post to learn more about how we do that through field experiences, and you can see the post about [Field Experience: Art Interpretation](https://www.long-view.com/blog/2019/field-experience-art-interpretation) or the one about [Field Experience: Data Visualization](https://www.long-view.com/blog/2019/field-experience-ut-vislab) to understand how we strive to get learners out into the world. 

But in this post, we want to tell you more about the experts who have come to us recently. Returning to our more regular cadence of hosting experts (after covid-related disruptions), last school year we welcomed many fascinating visitors both in person and virtually.

* [Dr. Jenna Moore](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq8MFBGuqDO/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) told scientists about her  “library” of worm specimens in the natural history museum in Hamburg.  
* [Jonathan Meiburg](https://www.instagram.com/p/CpVqx8npFje/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==), author of [A Most Remarkable Creature: The Hidden Life of the World's Smartest Birds of Prey](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/251787/a-most-remarkable-creature-by-jonathan-meiburg/), taught us about caracaras and shared pictures of his adventures in South America studying them.  
* Clayton Stromberger, The University of Texas’ On-campus Coordinator for [Shakespeare at Winedale Outreach](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/winedale/programs/outreach/), coached reader-writer thespians as they interpreted A Midsummer Night’s Dream.  
* [William Magnuson](https://www.instagram.com/p/ClzJvWLpSF0/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==), Associate Professor of Law at Texas A\&M University, gave us an overview of his latest book, [For Profit: The History of Corporations](https://www.amazon.com/Profit-History-Corporations-William-Magnuson/dp/1541601564). From ancient Rome,  to the East India Company, he told us about some of the earliest corporations, and he ended by talking about Toy R Us’s bankruptcy and the founding of Facebook by an individual in college.  
* [Emily Lessing](https://www.instagram.com/p/CjieI3sMjaw/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==), PhD student from The University of Texas’ Department of Integrative Biology, shared with us her research about animal recognition. She presented this work previously at [Science Under the Stars](https://scienceunderthestars.org/), one of our favorite outdoor lecture series.   
* [Eric Hiatt](https://www.instagram.com/p/CnOlfPWuj8Z/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==), PhD candidate at The University of Texas in The Jackson School of Geosciences, inspired us with his research into groundwater on Mars and gave us captivating information about the field of geophysics. And he even came back to tell us more in [Part 2.](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cne4o85pyDk/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)   
* [Susan Hewlitt](https://www.instagram.com/p/Clgq3hjOMex/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==), Executive Director of the Dell Children’s Foundation, taught us about health and equity.   
* [Dr. Adam Klivans](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~klivans/), Professor at The University of Texas, helped us explore envy-free cake-cutting procedures, which has possible applications such as resource allocation, conflict resolution, and artificial intelligence (his area of specialty). 

And perhaps the pinnacle of our interactions with professionals and specialists was [Build Week 14](https://www.long-view.com/blog/build-week-14): Get the Green Flag held in December. 

As we invited our guests to share their research and expertise, we encouraged these specialists to present to our children as they would a room of adults. “Please don’t make a ‘kid-version’ of this; present your work as interesting as it is,” we would tell them. Moreover, our learners held these experts to high standards, asking complex questions and demonstrating connections and background knowledge beyond their years when doing so.  

Our alumni even came back to share their knowledge and experiences with us. 

* [Margot ‘23 and Rosemary](https://www.instagram.com/p/Co7sYO2JdvB/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) ‘22 told us how they spend their Sundays— tutoring refugee families from Afghanistan.  
* [Lia, Avery, and Makhai](https://www.instagram.com/p/CjjKt0lpqyx/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) ‘22 shared hints, tips, and practices that they’ve discovered work well for reducing stress so far in their experience as high schoolers at St. Stephen’s.

These visitors and experts add a richness of experience and perspective beyond our walls for our learners (and teachers). And while we may not have a current learner grow up to be a scientist with a library of worms or an author of the next book on caracaras (but we just may), we most certainly will have learners who who have interests that are sparked and know there are many possibilities of what they might study or do. When experts come in, they remind us that the world is a fascinating place and nurture intellectual curiosity. 

# **Learning Within A Larger Ecosystem**

If you’ve visited Long-View, you know we are situated in a retro-style building that has floor to ceiling windows on all external walls. Every academic space thus has a big view of the world outside our school; depending on which room you are in, your view may encompass the leafy branches of a tree, cars on a busy street, or cyclists headed home. The school *feels* open and connected to the world beyond our walls, and truly *is* connected. In every way we can, we think of Long-View as a porous organization, and work to use and be part of the wider ecosystem of learning that exists around us.

We believe it is important to get out of school, and we do this often. Daily we venture several blocks away to an 84-acre park filled with heritage oaks and a running creek, spending an hour for lunch and play. We are there again when the work of our young scientists calls for the need to collect a water sample or observe an ant colony. We also walk to the university at the end of our street, capitalizing on the chance to study its immense outdoor sculpture collection, see a mass spectrometer in action in a geosciences lab, or tour the data visualization lab in the computer science building. We’ve taken the city bus to a downtown theater, walked to a coffee shop to use it as a venue for a slam poetry exhibition, tested the cardboard boats our engineering teams designed by floating them in a nearby lake, visited a robotics lab, sought out a university professor in order to interview him for a research paper, walked to a building being built nearby to talk to the construction engineer, and attended the undergraduate architecture students’ studio reviews at the end of the semester in order to study the feedback cycle key to their work process.

Our learners gain from these regular and frequent opportunities to leave school. They have expanded opportunities to learn, they stay connected with nature and with the outdoors, they feel a part of the vibrant fabric of our city, they communicate with a range of people, and they see possibilities of the world. They also grow their “wayfinding abilities” and have lines of sight to careers and the adult world.

Getting out is a key element of the Long-View experience, but so is inviting others into the learning happening within our own walls. We invite interesting people to teach us about their work, learning about “knot theory” from a local mathematician or “singing mice” from a doctoral student. During Build Weeks we’ve talked to an ex-CIA agent and someone who travels the world supporting countries writing new constitutions. We’ve chatted with authors to enrich our own work as writers and skyped with biomedical engineers to complement a science unit. And we also regularly open our doors to educators and researchers studying learning, such as when a team from Lego visited or when a group of math teachers traveled from another state to see our classes in action.

Learning is precipitated on openness, opportunity, connections, depth, and curiosity. At Long-View we don’t wait for these to find us, but actively seek them out. Interacting with professionals and specialists helps us gain perspective, learning about a high level topic or visiting a university resource brings the excitement of novelty, and getting outside or waking to a venue brings a change of environment and the understanding that the opportunity to learn is all around us.

## *Our daily and weekly schedule supports depth and balance.*

**From 9:00-2:30, Mondays-Thursday, we are working hard at Long-View.**

Unlike many schools, we don't waste time or spend our academic minutes on busy work. We don’t adhere to a rigid schedule of 40-minute subject increments. Most academic blocks are two hours long, and with 2 blocks a day we have an opportunity for deeper learning and the day has a more productive pace.

Additionally, our 4-day weekly schedule is purposeful and though this non-traditional schedule can be a change for families, most find it to be a huge opportunity. Fridays are a time for sports or music lessons, for trips to the museum with friends, for projects based on a kid's passions, a visit to the library and extended time to read, or some needed free time playing outside on a pretty day.
