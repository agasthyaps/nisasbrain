## Overview
A structured reflection process for teachers and school stakeholders to observe trends, discuss ideas for improvement, and examine data with an **equity lens**. Designed to elevate diverse perspectives in interpreting data.

## Step 1: Set Purpose
Questions to guide:
- What question are you answering by looking at this data?
- Predictions/assumptions about the data?
- Could these be informed by implicit bias?
- Clarify learning outcomes and relevant evidence.

For **student work**: Review learning outcomes, identify evidence, name assumptions, evaluate for bias.

For **summative data**: Identify assessment instruments, evaluate alignment, consider disaggregation.

---

## Step 2: Select the Data
- Identify qualitative/quantitative data aligned to purpose.
- Decide on disaggregation or anonymization.
- For student work: select problems to examine, create exemplars, anticipate varied strategies.
- For summative data: choose assessments, evaluate analysis tools, consider subgroup breakdowns.

---

## Step 3: Describe the Data
- Make **concrete observations**.
- Avoid “why” or “how” — stick to who/what/where/when.
- Use specifics: “On question 3…”
- For student work: sort samples by trends.
- For summative data: review notable performance items.

---

## Step 4: Interpret the Data
- Brainstorm interpretations: teacher actions, student/family beliefs, assessment design factors.
- Identify strengths/growth using person-first language and growth mindset framing.
- Check for bias in interpretations.
- Consider: completeness of the data picture, possible disadvantages in assessment, what students might say about results, and equity of interventions.

---

## Step 5: Determine Implications for Practice
- Identify what to continue, improve, or add.
- Plan for instruction, reteaching, and reinforcing skills.
- Ensure actions are within your control and support concept mastery.
- Visualize intended impact on future student work.
