# Data Driven Dialogue

_Developed by the Teacher Development Group, 2002. Based on work presented by Nancy Love, author of “Using Data/Getting Results,” 2002._

> “Dialogue comes from the Greek word *dialogos*. Logos means ‘the word,’ or in our case we would think of the ‘meaning of the word.’ And dia means ‘through’ – it doesn’t mean two... This will make possible a flow of meaning in the whole group, out of which will emerge some new understanding.” — *David Bohm, 1990*

## Purpose
This protocol builds awareness and understanding of participants’ viewpoints, beliefs, and assumptions about data while suspending judgments. All participants have equal voice. The 4 phases of data-driven dialogue assist groups in making shared meaning of data:

1. **Phase I: Predictions** – Surfacing perspectives, beliefs, assumptions, predictions, possibilities, questions, and expectations.
2. **Phase II: Go Visual** – Re-create the data visually.
3. **Phase III: Observations** – Analyzing the data for patterns, trends, surprises, and new questions.
4. **Phase IV: Inferences** – Generating hypotheses, drawing conclusions, and defining actions.

## Phase I – Predictions
Before viewing the data, participants reflect privately and record thoughts. Suggested prompts:
- I assume…
- I predict…
- I wonder…
- My questions/expectations are influenced by…
- Some possibilities for learning that this data may present…

---

## Phase II – Go Visual
Re-create data visually:
- Use large sheets, data walls, highlights, charts, and color coding.
- Work individually or in groups.
- Divide into subsets if necessary.

---

## Phase III – Observations
Engage with the data and note only observable facts:
- Quantities, percentages, numerical relationships.
- Avoid conjecture or explanation.
- Prompts: I observe that… | Patterns/trends I notice… | I can count… | I’m surprised that…

Avoid words like: _because, therefore, however, it seems_.

---

## Phase IV – Inferences
Generate multiple explanations for observations, identify additional needed data, propose solutions, and define data for monitoring implementation.
Prompts:
- I believe the data suggests… because…
- Additional data needed is…
- Solutions/responses that address needs…
- Data to guide implementation…

## Facilitation Plan (60–90 min)
1. Review protocol (3 min)
2. Data “owner” presentation (5 min)
3. Clarifying questions (4 min)
4. Phase I: Predictions (6 min total)
5. Distribute and examine data (7 min)
6. Additional clarifying questions (3 min)
7. Phase II: Go Visual (10–30 min)
8. Phase III: Observations (10 min)
9. Check-in with presenter (2 min)
10. Phase IV: Inferences (10 min)
