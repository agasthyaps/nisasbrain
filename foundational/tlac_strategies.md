Part One - Checking for Understanding
| Gathering Data on Student Mastery | Acting on Data and the Culture of Error | Setting High Academic Expectations | Planning for Success | Lesson Structure | Pacing |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Technique 1: Reject Self Report** | **Technique 7: Plan for Error** | **Technique 11: No Opt Out** | **Technique 16: Begin With The End** | **Technique 20: Do Now** | **Technique 27: Change the Pace** |
| Replace functionally rhetorical questions with more objective forms of impromptu assessment. | Increase the likelihood that you’ll recognise and respond to errors by planning for common mistakes in advance. | Turn “I don’t know” into a success by helping students who won’t try or can’t succeed practice getting it right (and being accountable for trying). | Progress from unit planning to lesson planning. Define the objective, decide how you’ll assess it, and then choose appropriate lesson activities. | Use a short warm-up activity that students can complete without instruction or direction from you to start class every day. This lets the learning start even before you begin teaching. | Establish a productive pace in your classroom. Create ‘fast’ or ‘slow’ moments in a lesson by shifting activity types or formats. |
| **Technique 2: Targeted Questioning** | **Technique 8: Culture of Error** | **Technique 12: Right is Right** | **Technique 17: 4 Ms** | **Technique 21: Name the Steps** | **Technique 28: Brighten Lines** |
| Ask a quick series of carefully chosen, open-ended questions directed at a strategic sample of the class and executed in a short time period. | Create an environment where your students feel safe making and discussing mistakes, so you can spend less time hunting for errors and more time fixing them. | When you respond to answers in class, hold out for answers that are ‘all-the-way right’ or all the way to your standards of rigour. | There are four criteria for an effective lesson plan objective: Manageable, Measureable, Made first, and Most important | Break down complex tasks into simple steps that form a path for student mastery. | Ensure that change in activities and other mileposts are perceived clearly by making beginnings and endings of activities visible and crisp. |
| **Technique 3: Standardise the Format** | **Technique 9: Excavate Error** | **Technique 13: Stretch It** | **Technique 18: Post It** | **Technique 22: Board = Paper** | **Technique 29: All Hands** |
| Streamline observations by designing materials and space so that you’re looking in the same consistent place every time for the data you need. | Dig into errors, studying them efficiently and effectively, to better understand where students struggle and how you can best address those points. | Reward ‘right’ answers with harder questions | Display your lesson objectives where everyone can see it and identify your purpose. | Model and shape how students should take notes in order to capture the information you present. | Leverage hand raising to positively impact pacing. Manage and vary the ways that students raise their hands, as well as the methods you use to call on them. |
| **Technique 4: Tracking, Not Watching** | **Technique 10: Own and Track** | **Technique 14: Format Matters** | **Technique 19: Double Plan** | **Technique 23: Control the Game** | **Technique 30: Work the Clock** |
| Be intentional about how you scan your classroom. Decide specifically what you’re looking for and remain disciplined about it in the face of distractions. | Have students correct or revise their own work, fostering an environment of accountability for the correct answer. | Help your students practice responding in a format that communicates the worthiness of their ideas. | As you plan a lesson, plan what your students will be doing at each point in class. | Ask students to read aloud frequently, but manage the process to ensure expressiveness, accountability, and engagement. | Measure time-your greatest resource as a teacher-intentionally, strategically, and often visibly to shape both your and your students’ experience in the classroom. |
| **Technique 5: Show Me** | | | | | **Technique 31: Every Minute Matters** |
| Flip the classroom dynamic in which the teacher gleans data from a passive group of students. Have students actively show evidence of their understanding. | | | | | Respect students’ time by spending every minute productively. |
| **Technique 6: Affirmative Checking** | | | | | |
| Insert specific points into your lesson when students must get confirmation that their work is correct, productive, or sufficiently rigorous before moving on to the next stage. | | | | | |

| Part 3 Ratio | Part 4 – Five Principles of Classroom Culture: Discipline, Management, Control, Influence, Engagement |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Building Ratio Through Questioning** | **Building Ratio Through Writing** | **Systems and Routines** | **High Behavioural Expectations** | **Building Character and Trust** |
| **Technique 32: Wait Time** | **Technique 37: Everybody Writes** | **Technique 42: Habits of Discussion** | **Technique 53: Radar/Be Seen Looking** | **Technique 58: Positive Framing** |
| Allow students time to think before answering. If they aren’t productive with that time, narrate them toward being more productive. | Prepare your students to engage rigorously by giving them the chance to reflect in writing before you ask them to discuss. | Make your discussions more productive and enjoyable by naming a set of ground rules or ‘habits’ that allow discussion to be more efficiently cohesive and connected. | Meet your students at the door, setting expectations before they enter the classroom. | Prevent non-productive behaviour by developing your ability to see it when it happens and by subtly reminding students that you are looking. | Guide students to do better work while motivating and inspiring them by using positive tone to deliver constructive feedback. |
| **Technique 33: Cold Call** | **Technique 38: The Art of the Sentence** | **Technique 43: Turn and Talk** | **Technique 56: Strong Start** | **Technique 52: Make Compliance Visible** |
| Call on students regardless of whether they’ve raised their hands. | Ask students to synthesise a complex idea in a single, well-crafted sentence. The discipline of having to make one sentence do all the work pushes students to use new syntactical forms. | Encourage students to better formulate their thoughts by including short, contained pair discussions-but make sure to design them for maximum efficiency and accountability. | Design and establish an efficient routine for students to enter the classroom and begin class. | Ensure that students follow through on a request in an immediate and visible way by setting a standard that’s more demanding than marginal compliance. Be judicious in what you ask for, specifically because it will uphold the standard of compliance. | Make your positive reinforcement strategic. Differentiate between acknowledgement and praise. |
| **Technique 34: Call and Response** | **Technique 39: Show Call** | **Technique 44: Batch Process** | **Technique 58: Present Invasive Intervention** | **Technique 60: Warm/Strict** |
| Ask your class to answer questions in unison from time to time to build energetic, positive engagement. | Create a strong incentive to complete writing with quality and thoughtfulness by publicly showcasing and revising student writing-regardless of who volunteers to share. | Give more ownerships and autonomy to students-by allowing for student discussion without teacher mediation, for short periods of time or for longer, more formal sequences. | Teach students the simplest and fastest procedure for executing key classroom tasks, then practise so that executing the procedure becomes a routine. | Take steps to get compliance without conflict by establishing an environment of purpose and respect and by maintaining your own poise. | Be both warm and strict at the same time to send a message of high expectations, caring, and respect. |
| **Technique 35: Break it Down** | **Technique 40: Build Stamina** | **Technique 49: Strategic Investment - From Procedure to Routine** | **Technique 55: Art of the Consequence** | **Technique 61: Emotional Constancy** |
| When a student makes an error, provide just enough help to allow her to ‘solve’ as much of the original problem as she can. | Gradually increase writing time to develop in your students the habit of writing productively, and the ability to do it for sustained periods of time. | Turn procedures into routines by rehearsing and reinforcing until excellence becomes habitual. Routinising a key procedure requires clear expectations, consistency, and most important, patience. Even so, it’s almost always worth it. | Ensure that consequences, when needed, are more effective by making them quick, incremental, consistent and depersonalised. It also helps to make a bounce-back statement, showing students that they can quickly get back in the game. | Manage your emotions to consistently promote student learning and achievement. |
| **Technique 36: Pepper** | **Technique 41: Front the Writing** | **Technique 50: Do It Again** | **Technique 57: What to Do** | **Technique 62: Joy Factor** |
| Use Pepper as a fast-paced, vocal review to build energy and actively engage your class. | Arrange lessons so that writing comes earlier in the process to ensure that students think rigorously in writing. | Give students more practice when they’re not up to speed-not just doing something again, but doing it better, striving to do their best. | Use specific, concrete, sequential, and observable directions to tell students what to do, as opposed to what not to do. | Celebrate the work of learning as you go. |
