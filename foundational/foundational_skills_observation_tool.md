About the Foundational Skills Observation Tool:
Comprehensive college-and career-ready literacy instruction in grades K–2 requires developing strong foundational skills and growing knowledge and vocabulary through rich read alouds with complex texts. Effective foundational skills instruction for all students necessitates spending at least 45 minutes a day on the teaching of foundational skills through direct instruction and related practice opportunities for students. This observation tool is designed to help K–2 teachers, and those who support teachers, to build understanding and experience with best practices to support the explicit teaching of foundational skills: Print Concepts, Phonological Awareness, Phonics and Word Recognition, and Fluency. Designed to aid teacher development rather than evaluation, this tool can be used for coaching, as well as planning, reflection, and collaboration.
This tool is a complement to the Foundational Skills Guidance Documents and should ideally be used along with instructional materials that provide explicit and systematic instruction and practice, regular evaluation of student work for evidence of learning, and other informal and formal assessments. For listening comprehension lessons, refer to the K–2 Instructional Practice Guide.
Using the Foundational Skills Observation Tool:
Depending on the grade level and time of school year, lessons could emphasize a variety of foundational skills. For all uses, refer to the Common Core State Standards for Reading: Foundational Skills. During each observed lesson, it will be important to note the interactions between aligned content, teacher moves, and student practice. Evidence for the indicators might include content from the lesson plan; observed exercises, tasks and assessments; and student work, discussion, or behavior. Although many indicators will be observable during the course of a lesson, there may be times when a lesson is appropriately focused on a smaller set of objectives or only a portion of a lesson is observed, leaving some indicators unobserved and some portion of this tool blank. Each of the indicators includes an optional rating scale.
A foundational skills lesson may include any of the following: whole class instruction, student independent practice, collaborative tasks, small group instruction, centers, and assessment opportunities. The observation tool can be used with any of these classroom structures.
Classroom observations are most effective when followed by a coaching conversation based on evidence collected during the observation. After discussing the observed lesson using this observation tool as a support, use the Beyond the Lesson Discussion Questions to put the content of the lesson in the context of the broader instructional plan for the unit or year.
Companion Resources:
Additional resources to support professional development and instructional practice can be found at achieve the core.org/foundational-skills. These include a modular course for professional development as well as classroom resources for decodable readers and assessment.

| **TD1. Foundational skill(s) instruction is explicit, clear, and correct.** | Clear and accurate teacher pronunciation of sounds (phonemes), visual aids, explanation of rules for sound and spelling patterns, articulation of objective to students, and modeling of blending, segmenting, or other content-specific tasks | |

Beyond the Lesson: Discussion Guide
Foundational Skills Observation Tool
The Beyond the Lesson Discussion Guide is designed for the post-observation conversation using the Foundational Skills Observation Tool. The questions put the content of the lesson in the context of the broader instructional plan for the unit or year.
Begin the conversation by reflecting on the evidence collected during the observation; discuss what worked, areas for improvement, and resources to support development. Then use the Beyond the Lesson Discussion Guide questions to help clearly delineate what practices are in place, what has already occurred, and what opportunities might exist—in another lesson, further in the unit, or over the course of the year—to incorporate the learning from the Foundational Skills Guidance Document into the classroom.
