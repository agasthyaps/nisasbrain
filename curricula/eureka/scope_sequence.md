# Eureka Math Scope and Sequence (PK–5)

## Overview

Eureka Math (also known as **Engage NY**) organizes mathematics instruction into a coherent series of **modules** that are analogous to chapters in a book. Each module is subdivided into **topics** (labeled A, B, C, etc.), and each topic contains individual lessons. The modules are designed to build on one another within and across grade levels so that students revisit and extend concepts. The table below lists the modules for each grade from pre‑kindergarten through grade 5. It is based on the **A Story of Units** curriculum map from Great Minds[\[1\]](https://greatminds.org/knowledge/resources/a-story-of-units)[\[2\]](https://greatminds.org/knowledge/resources/a-story-of-units#:~:text=,219). Detailed topic lists are provided for grades 2 and 3 because those were the only grades for which publicly accessible topic breakdowns were found.

## Kindergarten

Kindergarten lays the foundation for number sense and geometric reasoning. The curriculum map lists six modules for kindergarten[\[3\]](https://greatminds.org/knowledge/resources/a-story-of-units#:~:text=,Additional%20Student%20Materials):

| Module | Focus |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Module 1 – Numbers to 10** | Students count, read, and write numbers 0–10 and develop the ability to represent numbers with objects and drawings. |
| **Module 2 – Two‑Dimensional and Three‑Dimensional Shapes** | Learners compare and sort shapes by attributes and build models with blocks or clay. |
| **Module 3 – Comparison of Length, Weight, Capacity, and Numbers to 10** | Students compare the attributes of objects (longer/shorter, heavier/lighter, more/less) and extend counting to make comparative statements. |
| **Module 4 – Number Pairs, Addition and Subtraction to 10** | Children model and solve addition and subtraction situations within 10, using number bonds and informal strategies. |
| **Module 5 – Numbers 10–20 and Counting to 100** | The focus shifts to teen numbers and counting by tens; students learn that teen numbers are composed of ten and some ones. |
| **Module 6 – Analyzing, Comparing, and Composing Shapes** | Students compose simple shapes into larger composite shapes and analyze the attributes of the resulting figures. |

## Grade 1

In grade 1 the curriculum continues the **Story of Units** theme and introduces place‑value ideas. The Great Minds curriculum map lists six modules[\[4\]](https://greatminds.org/knowledge/resources/a-story-of-units#:~:text=,Teacher%20Edition):

Early topics encourage making or taking from ten; later topics explore solving change‑unknown or addend‑unknown problems and decomposing ten to solve problems[\[6\]](https://embarc.online/course/view.php#:~:text=).

3. **Ordering and Comparing Length Measurements as Numbers** – Children measure lengths using non‑standard and standard units and compare lengths by using numbers (e.g., determining which object is longer by comparing measurement counts).

4. **Place Value, Comparison, Addition and Subtraction to 40** – This module introduces tens and ones; students compare two‑digit numbers and use place‑value strategies to add and subtract within 40.

5. **Identifying, Composing, and Partitioning Shapes** – Learners identify attributes of two‑ and three‑dimensional shapes, compose new shapes from given shapes, and partition rectangles and circles into equal parts.

6. **Place Value, Comparison, Addition and Subtraction to 100** – Students extend place‑value understanding to 100, comparing numbers and solving problems that require composing and decomposing tens.

## Grade 4

The grade 4 modules build fluency with multi‑digit operations, introduce unit conversions, and lay the foundation for fraction equivalence and decimal fractions. The curriculum map lists seven modules[\[10\]](https://greatminds.org/knowledge/resources/a-story-of-units#:~:text=,7%3A%20Exploring%20Measurement%20with%20Multiplication):

| Module | Focus |

## Grade 5

Grade 5 deepens students’ understanding of place value into decimals, strengthens operations with fractions, and connects geometry to volume and the coordinate plane. The curriculum map lists six modules[\[11\]](https://greatminds.org/knowledge/resources/a-story-of-units#:~:text=,Student%20Workbook):

| Module | Focus |

## Discussion and Implications for Instruction

The **Eureka Math** sequence shows a deliberate progression from concrete experiences with counting and shapes in kindergarten to abstract reasoning with fractions, decimals, and coordinate geometry by grade 5. Each module not only introduces new content but also reinforces prior learning. For example, grade 2’s **Foundations of Multiplication and Division** module prepares students for grade 3’s intensive study of multiplication and division facts, while grade 3’s **Fractions as Numbers on the Number Line** lays essential groundwork for grade 4’s fraction equivalence module and grade 5’s fraction operations.

Some modules emphasize measurement and real‑world problem solving (e.g., grade 2’s **Addition and Subtraction of Length Units** and grade 4’s **Unit Conversions**). These units help students see mathematics as a tool for describing and comparing the world. The progression also reveals a pattern: each grade alternates between modules that focus on number sense and operations and those that focus on geometry or measurement, supporting a well‑rounded mathematical education.

Because access to detailed topic lists was limited, the report provides complete topic breakdowns only for grades 2 and 3, where reliable open sources were available[\[7\]](https://sites.google.com/sunol.k12.ca.us/2nd3rdgradewebsite/curriculum/math/2nd-grade-math#:~:text=Eureka%20Math%202nd%20Grade%20Module%2FTopic,Overview)[\[8\]](https://sites.google.com/sunol.k12.ca.us/2nd3rdgradewebsite/curriculum/math/3rd-grade-math#:~:text=Eureka%20Math%203rd%20Grade%20Module%2FTopic,Overview). For other grades, module descriptions were inferred from module titles and general curriculum knowledge. When planning instruction, teachers should consult the official Eureka Math teacher editions and pacing guides for full lesson‑by‑lesson details.
