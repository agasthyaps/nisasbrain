## Page 16


Techniques for Collecting Observation Data
Scripting
• Transcribed interactions between 
teacher and students or between 
students 
• Includes the conversations heard and the
actions observed


## Page 17


Techniques for Collecting Observation Data
Counting
• Captures a quantifiable moment of the 
lesson
• Examples include the number of hands 
raised after a posed question, the number 
of students who use one model, or the 
minutes taken to complete a problem


## Page 18


Capturing
Capturing
• Records what is seen on student papers
• Includes the work shown, such as the 
models and strategies used

Cycles of Observation and Debrief
Describe
▪ State specific, objective observation data that were scripted, counted, and/or captured.
Analyze
▪ Compare the observation data with the Eureka Math TEKS Edition lesson and the Implementation 
Support Tool. Decide which indicators were present, partially present, or absent from the 
observation, as well as the impact this had on student learning.
Prioritize
▪ Praise Progress: Prioritize a teacher action from the Implementation Support Tool to praise 
teacher progress and support it with specific observation data.
▪ Push Practice: Prioritize a teacher action from the Implementation Support Tool to push teacher 
practice and support it with specific observation data.
Commit
▪ Determine who will lead a feedback conversation and perform a follow-up observation, as well as  Toolkit
