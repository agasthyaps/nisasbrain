About The Instructional Practice Guide
Content-specific feedback is critical to teacher professional development. The Instructional Practice Guide (IPG) is a K–12 classroom observation rubric that prioritizes what is observable in and expected of classroom instruction when instructional content is aligned to college- and career-ready (CCR) standards, including the Common Core State Standards (CCSS), in Mathematics (corestandards.org/Math). It purposefully focuses on the limited number of classroom practices tied most closely to content of the lesson.¹
Designed as a developmental rather than an evaluation tool, the IPG supports planning, reflection, and collaboration, in addition to coaching. The IPG encompasses the three Shifts by detailing how they appear in instruction.²
Focus strongly where the standards focus.
Coherence: Think across grades and link to major topics within grades.
Rigor: In major topics, pursue conceptual understanding, procedural skill and fluency, and application with equal intensity.
This rubric is divided into the Core Actions teachers should be taking. Each Core Action consists of indicators which further describe teacher and student behaviors that exemplify CCR-aligned instruction.
Using The Instructional Practice Guide
For each observation, you should make note of what you see and hear. It may be helpful to supplement what you’ve recorded with further evidence from artifacts such as lesson plans, tasks, or student work. Although many indicators will be observable during the course of a lesson, there may be times when a lesson is appropriately focused on a smaller set of objectives or you observe only a portion of a lesson. In those cases you should expect to not observe some of the indicators and to leave some of the tool blank. Whenever possible, share evidence you collected during the observation in a follow-up discussion.
After discussing the observed lesson, use the Beyond the Lesson Discussion Guide to put the content of the lesson in the context of the broader instructional plan. The questions in the Beyond the Lesson Discussion Guide help delineate what practices are in place, what has already occurred, and what opportunities might exist to incorporate the Shifts into the classroom during another lesson, further in the unit, or over the course of the year.

BEYOND THE LESSON: DISCUSSION GUIDE
MATHEMATICS
INTRODUCTION
The Beyond the Lesson Discussion Guide is designed for the post-observation conversation using the Instructional Practice Guide (achievethecore.org/instructional-practice) or any other observation rubric. The questions put the content of the lesson in the context of the broader instructional plan for the unit or year. The conversation should first reflect on the evidence collected during the observation to consider what worked, what could improve, and what resources are available to support improvement. If any parts of the Lesson Planning Tool (achievethecore.org/lesson-planning-tool) were used in preparing for the lesson, refer to that information during the discussion. After discussing the observed lesson, use the “Beyond the Lesson” questions to help clearly delineate what practices are in place, what has already occurred, and what opportunities might exist in another lesson, further in the unit, or over the course of the year to incorporate the Shifts into the classroom.
1. Is this unit targeting the Major Work of the Grade? Does the prior unit target Major Work? Does the next unit target Major Work? How much time would you estimate will be spent on the Major Work in this class this year? (K–8) Focus means significantly narrowing the scope of content in each grade so that students achieve at higher levels and experience more deeply that which remains. For more information on Major Work of the Grade, see achievethecore.org/focus.
2. Does this unit target the Supporting Work of the Grade? If so, will this unit highlight the connection to the Major Work of the Grade? Explain how. (K–8) Supporting content enhances Focus and Coherence simultaneously by engaging students in the Major Work of the Grade. For example, materials for K–5 generally treat data displays as an occasion for solving grade-level word problems using the four operations (see 3.MD.3); materials for grade 7 take advantage of opportunities to use probability to support ratios, proportions, and percents.
3. Summarize how this lesson fits within the unit. Describe how the other lessons and tasks in this unit are intentionally sequenced to help students develop increasingly sophisticated understanding, skills, and practices. For more information on coherent connections across and within grades, see http://ime.math.arizona.edu/progressions/.
4. Which of the three aspects of Rigor (conceptual understanding, procedural skill and fluency, and application) are attended to within this unit? If more than one aspect is attended to, when in the unit are they attended to individually, and when are students using them together? Rigor is defined as pursuing conceptual understanding, procedural skill and fluency, and application with equal intensity. The standards are written using language that informs the reader as to which aspect of Rigor certain standards address. Some clusters or standards specifically require one aspect of Rigor; some require multiple aspects. All aspects of Rigor need not be addressed in every lesson.
5. How will you meet all students’ needs while working on grade/course-level content in this unit? (e.g., How will you provide scaffolding for students below grade/course level so they can reach the grade/course-level expectations? How will you create opportunities for students who are advanced to go deeper into the grade/course-level content?) For more information, see Adapting the Lesson under Problems 8 Exercises in the Lesson Planning Tool: achievethecore.org/lesson-planning-tool.
6. What off-grade/course-level standards have you taught this year and why? There may be reasons for addressing topics in a strategic way before or after the grade in which the topic is central in the standards. However, any such purposeful discrepancies should enhance the required learning, not unduly interfere with or displace grade/course-level content, and be clearly aimed at helping students meet the standards as written.
7. In what ways do you provide diagnostic feedback to students? Do students have opportunities to revise their thinking? Does student work include revisions of solutions, explanations, and justifications?
8. In what ways have you students made progress towards mastering the grade/course-level content standards? How are you monitoring and tracking their achievement of the standards? What work still needs to be done to ensure all students achieve mastery of each standard by the end of the year? For more information on the Standards for Mathematical Content, see corestandards.org/Math.
9. In what ways have you seen your students increase their independence in applying the Standards for Mathematical Practice in learning content this year? Which practice standards do students still need to develop and how can you support them in doing so? For more information on the Standards for Mathematical Practice, see corestandards.org/Math/Practice.
10. What tools are appropriate for students to independently access when solving mathematical problems in this unit? Do students frequently choose and use appropriate tools strategically in this class? For more information on SMP5, see corestandards.org/Math/Practice.
