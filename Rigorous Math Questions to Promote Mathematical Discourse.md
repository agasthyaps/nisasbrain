# Rigorous Math Questions to Promote Mathematical Discourse

## Asking better questions can open new doors for students, helping to promote mathematical thinking and encouraging classroom discourse. Such questions help students:

* ## Work together to make sense of mathematics.

* ## Rely more on themselves to determine whether something is mathematically correct.

* ## Learn to reason mathematically.

* ## Evaluate their own processes and engage in productive peer interaction.

* ## Discover and seek help with problems in their comprehension.

* ## Learn to conjecture, invent and solve problems.

* ## Learn to connect mathematics, its ideas and its applications.

* ## Focus on the mathematical skills embedded within activities.

Facilitating student engagement in mathematical discourse begins with the decisions teachers make when they plan classroom instruction. In the next and final blog in this series, we will dive into the specific strategies that teachers can use to foster meaningful conversations about what students are thinking, doing and learning.
