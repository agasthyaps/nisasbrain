**Teaching Lab Excellent Coaching Moves**

| 1\. Coach clearly defines the purpose/objective of the coaching conversation/meeting, how it builds upon prior coaching conversations, and how it will help the teacher improve student learning. |
| :---- |
| 2\. Coach models the expected change in teacher practice that will improve student learning with clarity and precision.  |
| 3\. Coach provides the teacher the opportunity to engage in deliberate practice of what the coach has modeled (with an emphasis on lesson rehearsal).  |
| 4\. Coach provides specific feedback to the teacher during and after deliberate practice.  |
| 5\. Coach and teacher study student work and/or data and use it to determine what teaching moves and/or instructional decisions to prioritize next. |
| 6 Coach builds the teacher’s content expertise by: Explaining and/or clarifying evidence-based practices.  “Putting on the student hat” and doing student tasks, assessment items, and/or exit tickets.  Internalizing/unpacking the unit or lesson.  Identifying ways to provide increased scaffolds and/or support to address student learning needs.  |
| 7\. Coach balances directive (i.e. clear, actionable guidance) and facilitative moves (i.e. questioning that prompts reflection and informs identification of next steps).  |
| 8\. Coach and/or teacher stamp the action steps that the teacher will take to apply new learning into their ongoing practice.   |
